# pi-paint VJ

Manual VJ rig for Raspberry Pi 5 + mini wireless keyboard + projector.
The main app is the older working pygame/OpenCV compositor for clips,
FX, favourites, autopilot, and projection mapping. Procedural generators
come from a separate GStreamer/GL worker process so shader work runs on
V3D without bringing the broken VLC/Gtk window path back.

## Quick start (no terminal needed)

On the Pi, open the file manager and navigate to this `vj/` folder.
Then double-click these files in order:

1. **`setup.sh`** — choose **"Execute in Terminal"** when prompted.
   Installs SDL2/OpenGL/GStreamer system libs, creates a Python
   virtualenv, installs pygame + opencv + numpy. Takes 2-5 minutes the first time.
   Safe to re-run; subsequent runs are a no-op.

2. Drop `.mp4` files into `assets/clips/`. Drop `.jpg` / `.png` images
   into `assets/images/`; the donut generator cycles through those as
   textures each time you return to it.

   For clean high-detail playback, drop raw cinematic video files into
   `assets/4k/`, then double-click **`assets/Process 4K Assets.sh`** once. The
   file can be 4K, 2K, or any other high-detail source; the processor
   writes Pi 5 GPU-playable HEVC clips into `assets/4k/processed/`.

   For portrait/vertical clips, drop them into `assets/portrait/`, then
   double-click **`assets/Process Portrait Assets.sh`**. It creates 1920×1080
   landscape versions in `assets/portrait/landscape/`.

   **To get videos off your phone**, double-click **`Upload from
   Phone.sh`** (see "Uploading clips from your phone" below) — no cable,
   no cloud, works with no internet.

3. To launch, double-click one of these scripts and choose **"Execute"**:
   - **`Start VJ.sh`** — **dual display** (the main mode). Opens a
     control HUD on the small screen (display 0) showing live preview,
     current state, and the key cheat sheet; sends the visual output
     fullscreen to the projector (display 1).
   - **`Test (single screen).sh`** — both windows on the primary
     display, no fullscreen. Use this when no projector is connected.
   - **`Start VJ (Live Cam).sh`** — same as `Start VJ.sh` but boots
     straight into the **live USB webcam** as the base layer. (You can
     also just press `\` any time during a normal run.) Plug in a USB
     webcam first; **`List Cameras.sh`** pops a dialog confirming it's
     detected.
   - **`Capture Face.sh`** — scan someone's face into a rotating 3D
     **point cloud** using the webcam (see "Face point clouds" below).
   - **`Start VJ (Faces).sh`** — same as `Start VJ.sh` but boots straight
     into the face point cloud as the base layer (or press `` ` `` any time
     during a normal run).

4. (Optional) Double-click **`Install Desktop Shortcuts.sh`** to drop
   launcher icons on your desktop so you don't have to navigate into
   this folder every time.

### Display layout

The default `Start VJ.sh` assumes:

| Display index | Role          | What's shown                              |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `0` (primary) | Small screen  | Control HUD: preview, state, key map      |
| `1` (secondary) | Projector   | Fullscreen visual output                  |

If your displays are wired up the other way, open `Start VJ.sh` in a
text editor and swap `OUTPUT_DISPLAY` and `CONTROL_DISPLAY` at the top.

### Keyboard focus

The keyboard sends keys to whichever window has focus — click into the
**control HUD** window once when you start a set and leave it focused.
Live FX parameters are tuned with the **arrow keys** (← → for PARAM X,
↑ ↓ for PARAM Y) so you don't have to fight the trackpad/mouse cursor
mid-set. The current values show as bars in the HUD. A few generators
also read these knobs — e.g. **dotsphere**: PARAM X (← →) sets rotation
speed (full left freezes it), PARAM Y (↑ ↓) sets how long it holds a
heading before it turns a new way (down = nervous, up = long lazy sweeps).

### Switching the output display

The HUD has an **OUTPUT DISPLAY** picker. Two ways to drive it:

- **Keyboard:** `F11` cycles the pending display, `F12` applies the pick.
  Works from either window because keyboard focus reaches the engine
  regardless of the WM's mood.
- **Mouse:** click a `Display N` button to set the pending display, then
  click `APPLY`. In fullscreen mode some window managers may yank focus
  back to the output; the keyboard shortcuts always work.

Switching is **live** in both windowed test mode and fullscreen mode.
Under the hood "fullscreen" is implemented as a borderless window
(`NOFRAME`) sized to fill the chosen display — this sidesteps the
[long-standing SDL2 bug](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/3192)
where `SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN` can't be reliably retargeted between
monitors. The output covers the full display the same way a true
fullscreen window would.

The applied choice is **persisted to `vj_state.json`** and used by every
subsequent launch. The launcher script's `OUTPUT_DISPLAY` only seeds
the very first run; the HUD picker wins after that.

### If "Execute" doesn't appear

Raspberry Pi OS file manager → **Edit → Preferences → General** →
turn ON **"Don't ask options on launch executable file"** (then a
single double-click runs them).

If that's not what you want, the dialog that pops up on double-click
has the right option — pick **"Execute"** for the Run scripts and
**"Execute in Terminal"** for setup so you can see install progress.

## Terminal install / launch (if you prefer)

```bash
cd vj
./setup.sh                                # same as the double-click

# Dual display — control HUD on display 0, fullscreen output on display 1
./venv/bin/python main.py --fullscreen --output-display 1 \
                          --control --control-display 0

# Single window, no HUD
./venv/bin/python main.py

# Heavier full-res mode if the Pi has headroom
./venv/bin/python main.py --width 1920 --height 1080 --fullscreen --output-display 1
```

## Keyboard map

The layout matches a standard QWERTY keyboard. Designed for the Tosuny /
Rii mini wireless keyboards (~70 keys + trackpad).

| Keys                | Action                                              |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `−` / `=`           | Cycle CLIP library (prev / next, auto-repeat on hold) |
| `[` / `]`           | Cycle GPU generator catalogue (prev / next, auto-repeat on hold) |
| `1`–`0`             | Clip favourite slots (10). Tap → play. **Hold ≥ ½ s → assign the currently-playing clip to that slot.** |
| `A S D F G H J K L ;` | Generator favourite slots. Tap → play. **Hold ≥ ½ s → assign the currently-playing generator to that slot.** |
| `Z`                 | HIT: strobe flash                                  |
| `X`                 | HIT: black flash                                   |
| `C`                 | HIT: invert flash                                  |
| `V`                 | HIT: zoom punch                                    |
| `B`                 | HIT: RGB smash                                     |
| `F1`                | FX: kaleidoscope (segments = PARAM X)              |
| `F2`                | FX: horizontal mirror                              |
| `F3`                | FX: feedback / trails (PARAM X = zoom, Y = rotate) |
| `F4`                | FX: invert (persistent)                            |
| `F5`                | FX: posterize (levels = PARAM Y)                   |
| `F6`                | FX: edge detect                                    |
| `F7`                | FX: RGB split / chromatic aberration (offset = PARAM X) |
| `F8`                | FX: melt — warp the base layer with a generator's colour field (kaliset by default; PARAM X = shimmer → full liquefy). Live mode only. |
| `\`                 | **LIVE CAM** — toggle the USB webcam as the base layer (takes over from clip / generator). In mapping PERFORM mode it sets the selected group's content to the live feed. Every FX / hit / overlay then runs on your live video. Auto-detects the camera; switch back to clips/generators with `−/=` or `[/]`. |
| `Shift+\`           | Flip the webcam left/right (selfie mirror; on by default) |
| `` ` `` (backtick)  | **FACE CLOUD** — toggle a baked face point cloud as the base layer (captured with `Capture Face.sh`). The head slowly rotates on its own; switch back to clips/generators with `−/=` or `[/]`. Live mode only. |
| `Shift+` `` ` ``     | **TWO FACES** — toggle a "two faces facing each other" view: the current baked face sits left, the next one right, each turned inward looking at the other (`,`/`.` re-pick the pair, arrows pan/tip them). With only one face baked it mirrors that face on both sides. Live mode only. |
| `,` / `.`           | Previous / next baked face (turns the face cloud on if it was off). Live mode only. |
| `← →`               | Adjust PARAM X (active-FX horizontal control). **With the face cloud active, turns the head left / right.** |
| `↑ ↓`               | Adjust PARAM Y (active-FX vertical control). **With the face cloud active, tips the head up / down.** |
| `Enter Enter`       | Engage **AUTOPILOT** (double-tap within 600 ms). Any other key takes over again and executes immediately. While engaged, `↑/↓` tune the clip-change rate and `←/→` tune the FX-change rate. |
| `F9` `F10`          | **Mapping only:** lower / raise the mapping compositing resolution (trades sharpness for framerate). The projector still gets a full-size GPU-upscaled image; only the internal composite shrinks. Shown on the HUD as `map res NN%`; persists. |
| `F11`               | Cycle the pending output display                   |
| `F12`               | Apply the pending output display (and persist it)  |
| `Space`             | Blackout toggle (panic button)                     |
| `Backspace`         | Freeze frame toggle                                |
| `M`                 | Toggle **MAPPING mode** (see section below)        |
| `N`                 | Toggle **4K CINEMATIC mode**. While active, `−` / `=` move through the 4K playlist; `Esc` exits cinematic mode. |
| `Esc`               | Panic: clear FX, hits, blackout/freeze. **Keeps the current clip _or_ generator playing** so you never drop to black unexpectedly. |
| `Shift+Esc`         | Quit                                               |

## Projection mapping mode (press `M`)

Mapping mode lets you carve the output into named **spaces** (quadrilaterals
on the projected frame), tie multiple spaces together into a **group** so a
single set of controls drives them all symmetrically, and stack multiple
groups so each one runs its own content + autopilot loop. Setup persists in
`vj_state.json` between sessions.

There are two sub-modes:

- **EDIT** — mouse-first. Drag rectangles in the HUD preview to create
  spaces, click to select, drag to move, drag corners to reshape, bind
  spaces together. No content gets assigned in this sub-mode (content / FX
  / favourite keys are swallowed) so you can focus on layout.
- **PERFORM** — keyboard-first. The keys you already know
  (`1-0`, `Q-P`, `A-L`, `F1-F7`, `←→↑↓`, `−/=`, `[/]`, `\` live cam) target
  the currently selected group. `Tab` cycles between groups.

Press `M` to enter / leave mapping mode entirely. Press `E` to switch
between EDIT and PERFORM inside it. The first time you enter mapping mode
the rig drops you straight into EDIT with a blank canvas; later launches
resume in PERFORM with your saved layout.

### Edit sub-mode (mouse-first)

Edit gestures work in **both** the HUD preview AND on the projector
itself — pointing at physical features through the projection is the
natural way to do projection mapping.

| Gesture                | Action                                          |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Click + drag empty area | Rubber-band a rectangle → becomes a new space in a new group |
| Click a space's body    | Pick that space (its group becomes the active group; corner handles + hover toolbar appear) |
| Click + drag a space's body | Move the whole space                        |
| Click + drag a corner handle | Reshape that corner of the picked space (it becomes the arrow-key target — a cyan ring marks it) |
| `←` `→` `↑` `↓`         | Nudge the arrow-key corner one pixel (hold `Shift` for 10px). Drag a corner roughly into place with the mouse, then dial it in pixel-by-pixel |
| Hover any space         | A small toolbar sprouts above its bounding box  |

The hover toolbar replaces the old keyboard-only editing commands. Each
button is a 4 %-of-canvas chip drawn just above the space:

| Button | Appears on              | Action                                  |
|--------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **×**  | Every space             | Delete this space (group goes too if it was the last) |
| **+**  | Hovered space that's in a different group from the picked one | Bind this space into the picked space's group (source group is deleted if it becomes empty); selection stays on the originator so you can chain binds |
| **⊘**  | Picked space whose group has ≥ 2 spaces | Unbind this space into its own new group |
| **G·n** | Every space            | Group-membership chip — also tappable to pick this space |

### Edit sub-mode (keyboard fallbacks)

| Key                 | Action                                            |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `E`                 | Leave EDIT sub-mode (back to PERFORM)             |
| `Esc`               | Cancel any in-flight drag / deselect              |
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | Cycle the active group (same as PERFORM)          |
| `M`                 | Leave MAPPING entirely                            |
| `Shift+click` other space | Bind into the picked space's group (same as toolbar **+**) |
| `B`                 | Arm bind — next plain click binds (alternative to Shift) |
| `U`                 | Unbind picked space (same as toolbar **⊘**)       |
| `Delete`            | Delete the picked space (same as toolbar **×**)   |

### Per-group frame controls (FRAME panel in the HUD)

A group's content plays **once, across the whole canvas**, and the group's
spaces are holes through which it shows. Two side-by-side spaces in one
group reveal the left and right portions of the same playing video —
not two copies of it. That's how you build "many windows, one underlying
video" compositions and use spaces as physical layers.

The video keeps its natural aspect — no warp distortion. Click the FRAME
panel buttons in the selected group's status panel to compose how the
video sits on the canvas:

| Control     | Action                                                    |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Mode pill   | Click to cycle: `window` → `fit` → `fill` → `stretch`. `window`, `fit`, `fill` all use the canvas as the playback surface and reveal it through the group's spaces. `stretch` is per-space — each quad warps its own copy of the video (the old billboard look, opt in when you want the angled-perspective distortion on purpose). |
| `−` / `+`   | Zoom the video ±15 % per click (window mode)              |
| `RESET`     | Zoom 1.0, pan 0,0                                          |
| ◀ ▲ ▼ ▶     | Pan the video ± 10 % of the canvas half-size per click — all spaces in the group shift in sync because they're windows onto the same plane |

Frame settings are saved per group in `vj_state.json` so the composition
you set up for a show is there again the next time you launch.

### Perform sub-mode + global mapping ops

| Key                 | Action                                              |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | Next / previous group (the active group's spaces get a coloured border on the projector) |
| `1-0` `Q-P` `A-L` `F1-F7` `←→↑↓` `−/=` `[/]` `\` | Apply to the SELECTED group only — each group keeps its own state (`\` sets the group's content to the live webcam) |
| `Ctrl+N`            | New group                                          |
| `Ctrl+Backspace`    | Delete the current group                           |
| `Ctrl+=` / `Ctrl+-` | Add / remove a space in the current group          |
| `Ctrl+G`            | Cycle pre-baked grid layouts (1·2x1·1x2·2x2·3x2·3x3·4x2·4x3) for the current group |
| `Ctrl+A`            | Toggle **autopilot** on the current group          |
| `Ctrl+K`            | Cycle autopilot kind: cycle/random clips, cycle/random generatives |
| `Ctrl+,` / `Ctrl+.` | Autopilot interval ± 1 second (default 8 s)        |
| `Ctrl+B`            | Toggle the on-projector selection border on/off    |
| `Ctrl+C`            | Cycle border colour (light gray / cyan / amber / violet / mint / red-pink — never white) |
| `Ctrl+[` / `Ctrl+]` | Border intensity ± 10 %                            |
| `Ctrl+;` / `Ctrl+'` | Border thickness ± 1 px                            |

Pitfalls worth knowing about:

- Border colour defaults to a **light gray** (180,180,180) — not white —
  with intensity at 100 %. Drop it via `Ctrl+[` / `Ctrl+]` if even light
  gray is too bright on your surface.
- Spaces are stored in **normalized 0..1 coordinates** so the mapping
  survives resolution changes, display switches, and Pi-OS-fontsize-
  induced surprises.
- Each group has its own random **time offset** so two groups running the
  same generative don't visually lock-step.
- `cv2.warpPerspective` is the bottleneck; we crop to the quad bounding
  box and apply a convex-poly mask so unmapped pixels stay pure black (no
  spill onto the wall). If you run >12 groups with different clips, the
  per-pool LRU may thrash — the live show should stay well below that.

### Browsing big libraries + favourites

Drop hundreds of clips into `assets/clips/`. Then:

1. **Cycle** through the library with `−` / `=` (clips) or `[` / `]`
   (overlays). Hold a key to auto-scrub at ~12/sec.
2. When you land on something you like, **long-press** any number key
   (`1`–`0`) for ~½ second. That clip gets assigned to that favourite
   slot. Do the same with `Q`–`P` for overlays.
3. **Tap** a number key (or `Q`–`P`) any time after that to instantly
   recall the assigned clip/overlay.
4. Favourites persist in `vj_state.json` between sessions — saved by
   filename stem, so re-ordering or processing files won't break them
   (only renaming does).
5. To clear a slot: cycle to a clip-free state first (or long-press `0`
   to clear that slot's binding, then cycle past), then long-press the
   slot you want to wipe. `Esc` keeps the clip playing on purpose, so
   it won't clear slots by itself.

The HUD shows two rows of 10 chips with the assigned stems, with the
slot whose clip is currently playing highlighted blue.

Position shows in the HUD as `name  [47/152]`. Open VideoCapture
handles are LRU-evicted (12 at a time) so a huge library doesn't
bloat memory.

Pick a clip then a generative (`A`-`L`) — generative wins until you
pick another clip.

### Autopilot

Double-tap **Enter** (within 600 ms) to engage autopilot. The engine
then drives itself:

- Picks a random clip (sometimes a generative instead) every
  ~`auto_clip_interval` seconds, with jitter.
- Toggles a random FX every ~`auto_fx_interval` seconds (caps active
  FX at 3).
- Drifts PARAM X/Y toward fresh random targets every couple of seconds.
- Occasionally swaps the overlay (or clears it).

Autopilot **never fires the punch-in hits** (strobe / black flash /
invert flash / zoom punch / RGB smash). Those are seizure / migraine
risks and only the operator should trigger them — `Z X C V B` are
always your call.

While autopilot is engaged, the HUD shows a green **AUTOPILOT** badge
with the current rates. The arrow keys retune the rates instead of
PARAM X/Y: `↑/↓` make clip changes faster/slower, `←/→` make FX
changes faster/slower.

**Any other key press** (Z for a strobe, a `5` to recall favourite 5,
F3 to switch on feedback, …) immediately disengages autopilot and
performs the action — perfect for grabbing back control when the
random output happens to land on something you want to embellish.

## Asset sources

Free libraries (download once, no internet needed at the party):

- **Base clips:** [Beeple VJ Loops](https://www.beeple-crap.com/vjloops),
  [Mantissa CC0 4K](https://mantissa.xyz/vj.html),
  [Videezy VJ Loops](https://www.videezy.com/free-video/vj-loop)
- **Overlays (fire, sparks, lasers, lens flares):**
  [Videezy Spark Overlays](https://www.videezy.com/free-video/spark-overlay),
  [Vecteezy Sparks](https://www.vecteezy.com/free-videos/sparks-overlay)

Overlay code still exists in the engine, but the controls are shelved
for now because the rig does not currently need overlay clips.

### Processing assets (HEVC)

The Pi 5 **hardware-decodes HEVC (H.265)** but has no hardware *encoder*,
so the model is: encode once (fast on a PC, or slowly on the Pi as a field
fallback), then the Pi just decodes. Everything 2K plays from
`assets/clips_hevc/` as **2048×1152 HEVC** via **`Start VJ (2K HEVC).sh`**.

Two ways to make those clips:

- **On your PC (fast — recommended for a library).** Use the
  `pc_clip_baker/` tool: drop sources in its `input/`, double-click
  **`Bake Clips.bat`** (NVENC on an RTX-class GPU), and copy the baked
  `output/` clips onto the Pi (the **`Upload from Phone.sh`** "2K clip —
  ready to play" destination drops them straight into `assets/clips_hevc/`).

- **On the Pi (slower, good for a few field clips).** Double-click
  **`assets/Process All Assets.sh`** — one pass that bakes **all three** kinds of
  source media, skipping anything already done:
  - `assets/clips/` (raw 2K landscape) → `assets/clips_hevc/`
  - `assets/portrait/…` (vertical) → `assets/clips_hevc/…-landscape.mp4`
  - `assets/4k/` (raw hi-res) → `assets/4k/processed/`

  It shows a GUI progress window when available and logs to
  `vj_last_process.log`. The per-type shortcuts **`assets/Process Assets.sh`**
  (2K only) and **`assets/Process Portrait Assets.sh`** (portrait only) just run
  the same processor scoped to one kind.

### 4K cinematic mode

This is part of the main app: start **`Start VJ.sh`**, then press `N`.
The normal VJ canvas goes black and a separate GStreamer/GL video window
plays the `assets/4k/processed/` playlist with the fastest Pi 5 path:
HEVC hardware decode → GL upload/convert → `glimagesink`. No FX, no
mapping, no CPU frame copy. The player keeps **one** window for the whole
session and swaps the file behind it when you cycle clips, so it never
flickers or re-grabs the keyboard between videos.

On the Pi/labwc projector setup, run **`Apply Fullscreen Rule.sh`** once
if the cinematic video window does not jump to the projector fullscreen.

**Controls are the same keys as everywhere else** — cinematic mode is not a
separate control scheme. The 4K video opens its own window on the projector
and holds the keyboard there, so while it's up the player reads the keyboard
directly (from its input device) and relays every press back to the normal VJ
controls — it works no matter which window has focus:

| Keys        | Action                                                    |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `−` / `=`   | Cycle the 4K playlist (same keys that cycle clips)        |
| `N`         | Leave cinematic mode (the same key you pressed to enter)  |
| `Esc`       | Leave cinematic mode                                      |
| `M`         | Leave cinematic and go to mapping                         |
| `[` / `]`   | Leave cinematic and cycle generators                      |
| `1`–`0`, `A`–`;` | Leave cinematic and play that favourite              |
| any other   | Leaves cinematic and does its usual thing                 |

(`q`/`Esc` also quit the 4K window directly as a hard safety backstop, so you
can never get trapped.) So you switch out of 4K with the exact same button
you'd press to do that thing normally — no need to memorise a separate exit.

Drop raw large files into `assets/4k/` and run **`assets/Process 4K Assets.sh`**
before a set. It also works if launched from inside the `assets/` folder.
The processor writes HEVC/H.265 MP4 files capped at
3840×2160 and 30 fps into `assets/4k/processed/`, leaving the raw source
files in place. If no processed files exist, cinematic mode will try the
top-level `assets/4k/` files directly, but unsupported codecs will fail
or skip; processing ahead of time is the reliable path.

### Live webcam (carry-around / wireless setups)

Plug a **USB webcam** into the Pi and press `\` — the live feed becomes the
base layer, and **every effect you already have runs on it**: kaleidoscope,
mirror, feedback trails, RGB split, edges, melt, the strobe/zoom hits,
overlays, and projection-map warps. It's the same pipeline as a clip, just
fed live. Great paired with a **wireless HDMI** transmitter so the Pi (with
the camera on top) becomes a roaming handheld unit.

- `\` — toggle the live cam on / off. `Shift+\` — flip the selfie mirror
  (on by default, so pointing it at yourself feels like a mirror).
- Switch back to clips / generators with `−/=` or `[/]` (that turns the
  cam off automatically).
- In **mapping** mode, `\` sets the selected group's content to the live
  feed — so you can project yourselves onto mapped shapes.
- Double-click **`Start VJ (Live Cam).sh`** to boot straight into the
  camera, or **`List Cameras.sh`** to confirm the webcam is detected.

The camera is **auto-detected** (the first `/dev/videoN` that delivers
frames — handy on the Pi, where the USB cam usually isn't `video0`), so
you don't need to know an index. It's captured at 1280×720 MJPG by
default and runs entirely on the CPU (no GL), exactly like the software
clip path. Heavy FX stacks on a live 720p feed will cost some frames on
the Pi 5 — drop a couple of effects if it dips.

### Face point clouds (scan a face, rotate it slowly)

Capture someone's face as a 3D **point cloud** from the webcam, then project
it slowly turning to catch different angles — turn the head left/right, tip it
up/down. Faces are saved so you can scan a whole bunch and cycle through them.

**Capturing:**

- Double-click **`Capture Face.sh`**. A preview window opens showing the
  webcam with the dense face mesh dotted on top.
- Sit so your face fills the frame and the dots track it, then press
  **SPACE** to bake it. The dialog confirms it saved (e.g. `face_003.npz`).
- Capture as many people / angles as you like in one session; press **ESC**
  when done. Each one lands in `assets/faces/`.
- The very first run installs the face-scanner into its own separate
  environment, then downloads the detector model — a one-time, few-minute
  download with a progress window. This is kept apart from the main app on
  purpose, so it can never disturb the proven show pipeline.

**Performing:**

- Press **`` ` ``** (backtick, top-left of the keyboard) to show the face
  cloud as the base layer. It **slowly rotates on its own**.
- Press **`Shift+`` ` ``** for the **two-faces-facing-each-other** view —
  the current face on the left and the next baked face on the right, each
  turned inward looking at one another (bake at least two friends for the
  full effect; with one it mirrors the same face). Arrows pan/tip the pair.
- **`,` / `.`** step to the previous / next face.
- **Arrow keys** turn it by hand: **← →** turn the head left/right, **↑ ↓**
  tip it up/down (added on top of the slow auto-drift).
- Every effect, hit and overlay runs on it, same as a clip. Switch back to
  clips / generators with `−/=` or `[/]`.
- Double-click **`Start VJ (Faces).sh`** to boot straight into it.

**Why it doesn't spin a full 360:** a single front-on capture only has data
for the *front* of the head — there's nothing behind it. So rotation is
deliberately clamped to a moderate turn/tip range; push past it and you'd be
looking into a hollow shell. The clamp is both the look you want and the only
thing one capture can honestly show.

It's pure CPU (numpy/OpenCV), no GL — the baked face is just a small file of
coloured 3D points, so the app loads it with no extra dependencies.

> the right, looking at each other). The single-face version above is the
> foundation for it.

### Portrait → landscape (three modes)

Vertical phone video becomes a 16:9 HEVC clip in `assets/clips_hevc/`
(named `…-landscape.mp4`). You choose **how** the tall frame is fitted by
which folder you drop it into — then run **`assets/Process Portrait Assets.sh`**
(or **`assets/Process All Assets.sh`**):

| Drop into | Mode | Best for |
|-----------|------|----------|
| `assets/portrait/rotate/` | **Rotate 90°** — spin the frame so it fills 16:9 | footage shot sideways, or where orientation doesn't matter |
| `assets/portrait/crop/` | **Crop to centre** — fill 16:9, cut top & bottom | a person / subject centred in frame |
| `assets/portrait/` (loose) | **Blur-fill** — whole frame centred, blurred side bars | anything you don't want cropped or rotated |

When uploading from your phone in the field, the **Portrait** destination
in `Upload from Phone.sh` offers these same three modes, so you pick per
clip and they land in the right folder automatically.

### Uploading clips from your phone

Shot something on your phone you want to project — campfire footage, the
wedding, whatever's happening that weekend? Get it onto the Pi straight
from the phone's browser. No cable, no cloud, and **no internet or WiFi
router required** — the Pi can make its own WiFi.

1. On the Pi, double-click **`Upload from Phone.sh`** → "Execute".
2. A dialog asks **how your phone should reach the Pi** — pick one:
   - **Pi hotspot (camp)** — for the campsite or anywhere with no router.
     The Pi becomes its own WiFi network; your phone joins it. This
     briefly takes the Pi off any WiFi it was on and puts it back when
     you're done.
   - **This WiFi (home)** — for home, where the Pi and your phone are
     already on the same WiFi. Nothing on the Pi switches; your phone
     keeps its internet.
3. The next dialog shows the details for the mode you picked — a WiFi
   name/password to join (hotspot) or just an address (home WiFi). On
   your phone, get on the right network, then open that address in your
   browser (hotspot mode is normally **`http://10.42.42.42:8000`**).
4. On the page, **pick where the videos go**, then tap **Choose videos**,
   pick clips from your camera roll, and watch the progress bars. The
   destination dropdown routes each upload to the right folder:
   - **2K clip — ready to play (HEVC)** → `assets/clips_hevc/`. For clips
     you already baked on your PC (see *Processing assets* above); they
     play immediately, no Pi-side processing.
   - **2K video — raw** → `assets/clips/`, to be baked on the Pi.
   - **4K video** → `assets/4k/`, for cinematic mode.
   - **Portrait (vertical)** → `assets/portrait/…`; a second dropdown
     picks how the tall frame becomes 16:9 — **crop to centre** (good for
     a person), **rotate 90°** (good for sideways-shot footage), or
     **blur-fill** (keep the whole frame). Each goes to its own subfolder.
5. Back on the Pi, click **Done** in the dialog. That stops the upload
   page (and, in hotspot mode, puts the Pi's WiFi back to normal).
6. If you uploaded anything **raw** (2K/4K/portrait), double-click
   **`assets/Process All Assets.sh`** and go eat dinner — it bakes everything to
   play-ready HEVC while you're away. Clips you uploaded as *ready HEVC*
   need no processing.

Notes:
- **Shoot in landscape when you can.** For vertical footage, use the
  Portrait destination and pick crop / rotate / blur-fill to suit the
  shot.
- Uploads stream straight to disk and only become visible once fully
  received, so a dropped connection mid-upload won't leave a broken clip
  for the processor to choke on.
- If the Pi's own hotspot can't start on a given machine, the launcher
  falls back to serving the page on whatever WiFi the Pi is already on
  and shows you the address to use — just make sure your phone is on that
  same WiFi.
- The WiFi name, password, **address, and port** are all settings at the
  top of `Upload from Phone.sh` (`HOTSPOT_SSID`, `HOTSPOT_PASS`,
  `HOTSPOT_IP`, `PORT`). The Pi's address is fixed at `HOTSPOT_IP`
  (default `10.42.42.42`), so the URL is the same every time — change it to
  anything in a private range (e.g. `192.168.4.1`) if you prefer, and the
  phone gets a matching address automatically.
- The full log is written to `vj_last_upload.log`.

## MilkDrop visuals (projectM)

Real Winamp-era **MilkDrop** visualizations, rendered by
[projectM](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm) and slotted in
as ordinary generators — they live in the same `[` / `]` cycle as the GLSL
generators (right after them), and work with favourite slots, autopilot,
and mapping groups exactly the same way.

**One-time install:** double-click **`Setup ProjectM.sh`** ("Execute in
Terminal" — it needs your password once, like `setup.sh`). It builds the
projectM library and downloads a MilkDrop preset pack that was
benchmarked on a Pi 5 and filtered to only presets that hold a smooth
frame rate. The build takes 15–40 minutes; let it sit. After that,
`Start VJ.sh` as usual.

- **Audio-reactive:** plug a **USB microphone** into the Pi and the
  visuals beat-react to the room's sound, just like Winamp did. With no
  mic they fall back to a built-in synthetic beat so they still move.
- **PARAM X** (`← →`) controls beat sensitivity for these visuals.
- The cycle takes a 40-preset sample of the pack so it stays browsable.
  To hand-pick which presets appear (and their order), create a
  `projectm_playlist.txt` in the app folder with one preset name per
  line (full filename not needed — any unique part of the name works;
  `#` lines are comments). The pack lives in `assets/projectm_presets/`.
- Presets render at the reduced generator resolution and are upscaled to
  the canvas like every other generator, so the 2K output path is
  unchanged. If a preset stutters, just cycle past it.
- Troubleshooting goes to the usual `vj_last_run.log` (look for
  `[pm-worker]` lines) and `vj_last_projectm_setup.log` for the install.

## Architecture

```
main.py        argparse + pygame init + main loop wiring; opens the
               output window via pygame.display + a second SDL2
               Window+Renderer for the control HUD
engine.py      Engine class: state, render pipeline, public actions.
               Splits compose_frame() (numpy) from blit_to_output()
               (pygame) so the same frame can feed both windows.
control.py     ControlWindow: preview, state badges, cached key
               cheat sheet. Renders to an offscreen Surface and
               uploads as a Texture each frame.
effects.py     Transformative numpy/OpenCV effects + CPU generator fallbacks
shader_catalog.py / gpu_generator_worker.py
               GStreamer/GL shader generators in a separate process
clips.py       ClipPool: lazy MP4 loader keyed by slot index
camera.py      CameraSource: threaded USB-webcam capture (live base layer)
facecloud.py   FaceCloud + FacePool: software point-cloud base layer
               (loads baked .npz faces, rotates + splats them; no GL, no
               landmark model at runtime)
face_capture.py Offline face-scan tool (MediaPipe Face Mesh ONNX → .npz), run
               in its own venv_face/ by "Capture Face.sh" — never imported by
               the main app
keymap.py      Pygame key → engine action dispatch table
config.py      Config dataclass
cinematic4k.py System-Python GStreamer/GL player for N-key 4K cinematic mode
```

Render pipeline each frame:

```
base layer   →  live webcam OR face point cloud OR active clip OR active generative OR black
   ↓
FX chain     →  kaleido, mirror, rgb_split, posterize, edges, invert, feedback, melt
   ↓
hits         →  transient strobe/flash/punch (5 frames)
   ↓
blit to pygame screen
```

`prev_frame` is captured before the next render so feedback works.

## Performance notes

- Default render resolution is **1280×720**. The output surface scales
  to the display via `pygame.transform.smoothscale` (bilinear) or the
  optional GPU scaler, so the same canvas can still present cleanly on
  the 4K projector. Clip downsampling uses `cv2.INTER_AREA` for clean
  anti-aliased shrinking and `cv2.INTER_LINEAR` for upscaling.
- **`assets/Process Assets.sh` bakes every clip to the render
  resolution** so the per-frame `cv2.resize` is a no-op at playback —
  the only per-frame cost is the unavoidable H.264 decode and a BGR→RGB
  shuffle. The processor reads its target size from `config.py`, so
  the two stay in sync. If you change the render resolution (via
  `--width / --height` or by editing `config.py`), **re-run the
  processor** so your library is at the new size; otherwise the engine
  will live-resize every frame and print a one-time warning per file.
- If the Pi has spare headroom and you want crisper output, bump to
  `--width 1920 --height 1080` and re-run **`assets/Process Assets.sh`**.
- **Generatives render at `--gen-render-scale × canvas` (default 0.5).**
  They're smooth procedural patterns — pixel-perfect rendering at canvas
  resolution is wasted CPU. At 0.5, a 4-group mapping setup with mixed
  FX cuts the generative pixel count by 4×, with no visual difference
  for plasma / waves / cells /
  moire / metaballs. Try `--gen-render-scale 0.33` if you need more
  headroom (almost-3× again); back off to 1.0 if you're driving a tunnel-
  style sharp checker pattern as the base layer and want pixel-perfect
  edges. Clips and overlays are unaffected — they keep their detail.
- `kaleidoscope` is the heaviest effect (per-pixel remap). Stack 2-3
  effects max for headroom.
- MP4 decode uses OpenCV's `VideoCapture` — relies on libavcodec; on
  Pi 5 it does software H.264 decode but stays well under a frame budget
  for 854×480.
- In **mapping mode** the per-group mask is cached by space-corner
  signature — a running set pays the `cv2.fillConvexPoly` cost once,
  not every frame. Edits invalidate the cache automatically. Dead
  groups get garbage-collected every ~5 s.
- Clip frames are read **once per render**, so don't try to play more
  than one clip slot simultaneously — only the most recently selected
  base and overlay are advanced.

## Not yet built (Phase 2/3)

- **Auto mode:** aubio beat detector listening on a USB mic, scenes
  swap on downbeats, hits fire on kick onsets, FX intensity scales
  with smoothed RMS energy.
- **Hailo person matte:** silhouette the dancer/DJ from the webcam,
  composite over the base — fire and lasers "shoot from hands."
- **Pre-baked Shadertoy MP4s:** bake favorite shaders offline to
  854×480 H.264 loops so the rig can play them back without live GLSL.
