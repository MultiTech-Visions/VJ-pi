Read this before acting. The project has a long history of expensive
mistakes; the operator has a low tolerance for repeats. The short
version: **the working system is the hybrid described below. Build on
it. Don't try to rebuild it.**

## What this project is

A manual VJ rig for a Raspberry Pi 5 + projector + tiny wireless
keyboard. The operator triggers clips, generators, FX, hits, and
projection-mapping warps from the keyboard while watching a control
HUD on a second screen. Full operator-facing docs (keymap, mapping
mode, autopilot, asset prep) live in `README.md` — that file is
current; trust it.

## Architecture — the hybrid (this is what works)

Two halves, deliberately split across a process boundary:

1. **Main app: pygame + OpenCV/numpy.** The proven CPU compositor.
   Owns clips, the FX chain, hits, favourites, autopilot, and
   projection mapping. One pygame output window (the projector) plus
   a second SDL2 window for the control HUD. Render pipeline per
   frame: base layer (clip / generative / black) → FX chain → hits →
   blit. This is the original working code path, restored after the
   rewrite detour.

2. **GPU generators: a separate GStreamer/GL worker process.**
   `shader_catalog.py` holds GLSL fragment shaders; `gpu_generator_
   worker.py` runs them through `videotestsrc ! glupload ! glshader !
   gldownload ! appsink` and pipes RGB frames back over a pipe.
   `gpu_generators.py` is the client/bridge in the main process.

   **Why a separate process:** V3D leaks GL state between contexts in
   the same process — two coexisting GL/EGL contexts corrupt each
   other (symptom: one surface goes solid black). Isolating all GL in
   its own process is the structural fix. **Do not merge the GL worker
   back into the main pygame process** — that reintroduces the exact
   bug that wasted weeks.

The main app stays on CPU (numpy/cv2); the GPU is reached only through
the out-of-process worker. That separation is the whole point of the
hybrid — respect it.

### Adding a generator (the fun part)

Add a GLSL fragment shader string to the `GPU_GENERATORS` dict in
`shader_catalog.py`. That's it — it auto-wires into the `[`/`]` cycle,
the generator favourite slots, and autopilot, because everything reads
from that dict (`GPU_GENERATOR_ORDER`). Shaders are GLSL ES (`#version
100`) and get `time`, `width`, `height` uniforms for free. For a
texture-mapped generator, see `donut`: the worker routes it through a
`uridecodebin … imagefreeze … glupload ! glshader` path that binds an
image from `assets/images/` as `sampler2D tex`.

## Repo layout

- `main.py` — argparse + pygame init + window setup + main-loop wiring.
- `engine.py` — `Engine`: state, per-frame render pipeline, public
  actions. The big one.
- `control.py` — `ControlWindow`: HUD preview, state badges, key sheet.
- `effects.py` — numpy/OpenCV FX + CPU generator fallbacks.
- `mapping.py` — projection-mapping mode (spaces, groups, warps).
- `clips.py` — `ClipPool`: lazy MP4 loader, LRU-evicted handles.
- `camera.py` — `CameraSource`: threaded USB-webcam capture (the live
  base layer, toggled with `\`). Pure CPU/V4L2, no GL — auto-probes for
  the camera. `list_cameras.py` + `List Cameras.sh` report detected
  devices; `Start VJ (Live Cam).sh` boots straight into it.
- `facecloud.py` — `FaceCloud` + `FacePool`: the face point-cloud base
  layer (toggle `` ` ``, cycle `,`/`.`, arrows turn/tip the head; Shift+`` ` ``
  is the two-faces-facing-each-other view — `engine._render_face_duo` draws
  the current face left + `FacePool.peek(1)` right, each turned inward via
  `render(cx=…, fit=…, into=…)`). Loads baked `.npz` faces and software-splats
  them rotating in a clamped yaw/pitch range. **Pure numpy/cv2, no GL, and no
  landmark model at runtime** — faces are baked offline, so the show pipeline
  gains the feature without the dependency.
- `face_capture.py` — offline face scanner → `.npz` point cloud. InsightFace
  detects the face (bbox only); the dense **MediaPipe Face Mesh** model (478
  landmarks, `assets/models/face_mesh.onnx`) runs on the crop via
  onnxruntime; the landmarks are Delaunay-triangulated and each triangle
  filled with a barycentric point grid (~8k coloured points). Run by
  `Capture Face.sh` in its **own** `venv_face/` (deps in
  `requirements-face.txt`); deliberately never imported by the main app so
  the landmark stack can't perturb the proven venv. **The MediaPipe *package*
  ships no aarch64/Python-3.13 wheel (Debian 13 broke the original) — but the
  Face Mesh *model* runs fine as ONNX, so the dense mesh is preserved without
  the dependency. (An InsightFace-106 + multi-pose-merge attempt was tried and
  scrapped — too sparse and it ghosted.)** Faces live in `assets/faces/`
  (gitignored, like clips); the mesh model ships in the repo.
- `keymap.py` — pygame key → engine action dispatch.
- `projectm_presets.py` / `projectm_worker.py` — **MilkDrop generators via
  libprojectM v4**, a third out-of-process GL worker. `projectm_presets.py`
  scans `assets/projectm_presets/` (gitignored; installed by
  `Setup ProjectM.sh` from a Pi-5-FPS-filtered pack) and exposes `pm:<stem>`
  names that engine.py appends to `GENERATIVES`, so they ride the existing
  [/] cycle / favourites / autopilot / mapping unchanged. The worker holds
  ONE EGL/GLES3 context (raw ctypes, no GStreamer GL) backed by a **PBUFFER
  surface**, and speaks the same JSON+raw-RGB pipe protocol as
  `gpu_generator_worker.py`. ⚠️ The pbuffer is load-bearing, not incidental:
  released libprojectM (≤v4.1.6) renders its final pass to the **default
  framebuffer (FBO 0)**. The worker originally used a *surfaceless* context,
  which has no FBO 0 — so every render threw `GL_INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION`
  (0x0506) and came back **black**, and the broken pipeline state wedged V3D
  after a few presets (neon-green freeze). A pbuffer gives a real FBO 0 to
  render into; readback is from FBO 0. (The `projectm_opengl_render_frame_fbo`
  caller-FBO API exists only on projectM **master** — the anticipated v4.2.0
  never shipped; if a master build is ever used, the worker auto-detects
  `render_fbo` and targets its own FBO instead. Don't revert to surfaceless.)
  `Diagnose ProjectM.sh` / `projectm_diag.py` render presets offscreen to
  check black-vs-not without the live display (set `VJ_PM_SOFTWARE=1` to force
  llvmpipe — cannot freeze V3D). `VJ_PM_SWITCH_MS` (default 350) rate-limits
  preset loads so rapid [/] cycling can't trigger a shader-recompile storm.
  All `pm:*` names
  share ONE worker process (bridge key `projectm`, one EGL context — V3D
  rule), but that worker holds an **LRU pool of projectM instances, one per
  active preset** (`VJ_PM_INSTANCES`, default 12). This is load-bearing for
  MAPPING: a scene with several pm:* boxes wants several distinct presets at
  once, and a single instance would reload+recompile shaders every box every
  frame — which dropped a multi-preset mapping scene to ~0.25fps (`gen` phase
  ~800ms/frame). With the pool each box renders its own warm instance; shaders
  compile ONCE per preset. Per-frame cost scales with boxes on screen, not pool
  size (only requested presets render). New-instance creation (a compile) is
  throttled to one per `VJ_PM_SWITCH_MS` (default 400) so a fast [/] browse or
  a scene loading all at once can't storm V3D; the pool MUST be ≥ the distinct
  presets on screen or it thrashes (evict→recreate→recompile). Multiple
  instances coexisting in one EGL context was verified on V3D. Audio: GStreamer
  **audio-only** mic capture thread (`VJ_PM_AUDIO_SRC`,
  default autoaudiosrc) → `projectm_pcm_add_int16`; synthetic ~120BPM
  fallback when no mic. PARAM X = beat sensitivity. Tunables: `VJ_PM_MAX`
  (cycle sample, default 40), `projectm_playlist.txt` (operator curation),
  `VJ_PM_MESH` (default 48x32). `Setup ProjectM.sh` builds libprojectM
  v4.1.6 `-DENABLE_GLES=ON` into `vendor/projectm/` (Debian only ships
  v2/v3) and clones the preset + texture packs; the worker runs on system
  python3 (needs `python3-numpy`, installed by that setup). Pi 5 Mesa exposes
  GLES **3.1** (not 3.2); projectM's core renderer runs on it fine — the
  GLES-version gap was a red herring, the real bug was the surfaceless context
  (see pbuffer note above). Whether V3D sustains MilkDrop on the *live* GPU
  without hanging is the remaining on-hardware unknown.
- `shader_catalog.py` — GLSL generator catalogue (`GPU_GENERATORS`).
- `gpu_generator_worker.py` — out-of-process GStreamer/GL renderer.
- `gpu_generators.py` — client/bridge that talks to the workers. Uses a
  **1-deep render pipeline**: render() reads the PREVIOUS frame's response
  (the worker had a whole compositor frame to make it, so it's ready and
  doesn't block) and returns the cached frame, taking the GL round-trip OFF
  the compositor's serial Phase-1 I/O. A heavy mapping scene that mixed a
  generator with other content was bounded by the generator's ~70ms blocking
  round-trip on the critical path (7fps); pipelining drops the frame to the
  next-slowest box (~15fps) while the generator just refreshes a frame later.
  Costs: a generator is ONE frame stale (imperceptible) and shows the worker's
  previous frame for one frame on a switch (vs a black flash). The bridge is
  called serially from the main thread (Phase-1 I/O is not thread-safe), so
  the pipe FIFO needs no locks; `_pause_one` drains pending responses before
  the pause ack to avoid a pipe desync. **projectM is the exception**: all
  `pm:*` go through `PmStreamWorker`, a BACKGROUND THREAD that owns the pm
  worker's pipe and renders every on-screen preset round-robin into a lock-
  guarded cache, so several pm boxes can be mixed (up to ~5) without any of
  them blocking the compositor — the simple batched approach can't, because one
  rendered frame (~1MB) far exceeds the ~64KB OS pipe buffer, so the worker
  would stall on writes. The main thread only touches the cache (request latest
  size / grab latest frame). Per-preset rendering is paced to `VJ_PM_STREAM_FPS`
  (default 30) so the thread doesn't hog V3D; presets not requested for 0.5s are
  dropped. Scene stays smooth; each pm box refreshes at the worker's pace (5
  presets ≈ 13fps each). GLSL generators keep the simple inline pipeline.
- `config.py`, `state.py`, `display_helpers.py` — config dataclass,
  `vj_state.json` persistence, display geometry helpers.
- `assets/clips/` — operator's MP4 library. **Gitignored** (see
  workflow rules — the library was destroyed once).
- `assets/images/` — stills for texture generators (donut). Gitignored.
- `setup.sh` — system libs (SDL2/GL/GStreamer) + a Python venv with
  pygame + opencv + numpy. Re-runnable.
- `assets/Process All Assets.sh` — unified HEVC processor (2K + portrait +
  4K → the formats the app plays). `assets/Process {Assets,Portrait
  Assets,4K Assets}.sh` are thin `VJ_ONLY=` wrappers. All the processing
  launchers live in `assets/` (with the assets), not the repo root.
- `Start VJ.sh` / `Test (single screen).sh` — launchers (log-tee +
  zenity error dialog; see operator note below).
- `Update.sh` — git pull + setup-change warning.
- `vj_last_run.log`, `vj_last_update.log`, `vj_last_process.log` —
  last-run logs, overwritten each run.

## Hard hardware / platform facts (non-negotiable)

1. **V3D leaks GL state between contexts in one process.** This is why
   GPU generators live in a separate process. Don't co-locate GL
   contexts. (This killed two earlier GPU attempts — see history.)

2. **Pi 5 has no H.264 hardware decode** (the block was removed), **but it
   DOES hardware-decode HEVC (H.265)** — and that's the current direction
   for 2K clips (see "2K HEVC migration" below). The legacy H.264 path
   still works: clips decode in software via OpenCV `VideoCapture`, and
   `Start VJ.sh` plays `assets/clips/` at render resolution.

3. **The operator launches via the GUI file manager** ("Execute", not
   "Execute in Terminal"), so stdout/stderr go nowhere unless captured.
   The log-tee + zenity dialog in the launchers exist for exactly this.
   Don't break them.

## 2K HEVC migration (current direction)

The Pi 5 hardware-decodes HEVC but can't hardware-*encode* it, so the
clip pipeline is moving to: **encode once to HEVC (fast on a PC, slow on
the Pi), then let the Pi hardware-decode.** Key pieces:

- **Playback:** `--hevc` mode (`Start VJ (2K HEVC).sh`) reads
  `assets/clips_hevc/` and decodes via `hevc_clips.HevcClipPool` +
  `hevc_decode_worker.py` — an out-of-process worker doing HW HEVC decode
  (`v4l2slh265dec`) + **ISP detile (`pispconvert`), NOT GL**. ⚠️ The worker
  MUST stay GL-free: the main app holds a V3D GL context (`--gpu-scale`),
  and a *second* GL context in the worker (the old
  `glupload!glcolorconvert!gldownload` path) silently outputs ALL-BLACK
  frames — the V3D dual-context blackout, manifesting **across processes**.
  This wasted a debug cycle (symptom: clips "cycle" but projector stays
  black). The converter order is `pisp → videoconvert → gl` (gl last,
  in-app-broken); override with `VJ_HEVC_CONV`. Worker errors log to
  `vj_last_hevc_worker.log` (never `/dev/null` again — that hid the cause).
  Needs `gstreamer1.0-pispconvert`. Clips are baked to **2048×1152 HEVC**
  (hvc1 / main / yuv420p); canvas runs `--width 2048 --height 1152
  --gpu-scale`.
- **PC baking (fast path):** `pc_clip_baker/` (`Bake Clips.bat` /
  `bake_clips.py`) uses NVENC to make those 2048×1152 HEVC clips; copy
  them into `assets/clips_hevc/`.
- **On-Pi processing (fallback):** `assets/Process All Assets.sh` is the unified
  processor — 2K (`assets/clips/`→`clips_hevc/`), portrait
  (`assets/portrait/{rotate,crop}/` + loose → `clips_hevc/…-landscape`),
  and 4K (`assets/4k/`→`assets/4k/processed/`), all HEVC, skipping done.
  `assets/Process Assets.sh` / `assets/Process Portrait Assets.sh` are thin wrappers
  (`VJ_ONLY=clips|portrait`). On-Pi HEVC encode is software (slow) — fine
  for a few field clips, not a whole library.
- **Uploads:** `upload_server.py` + `Upload from Phone.sh` route phone
  uploads to the right folder (ready-HEVC→`clips_hevc/`, raw 2K→`clips/`,
  4K→`4k/`, portrait→`portrait/{rotate,crop}/` or loose) via the page's
  destination picker.
- **Legacy H.264 path is intentionally kept** (`Start VJ.sh` +
  `assets/clips/`) until HEVC is confirmed on the operator's hardware —
  do not rip it out. `assets/clips/` doubles as the raw-input folder the
  HEVC bake reads from.

## How to test changes

1. Make the edit.
2. Commit + push to the active branch.
3. Operator does `git pull` on the Pi and runs the relevant launcher.
4. Ask for the matching `vj_last_*.log` (or the observed behaviour).
5. Iterate.

GLSL can't be compile-checked in most dev environments (no validator);
the worker on the Pi is the real test — on failure, grab the
`[gpu-worker]` line from the log. If agent + operator share the Pi via
`claude --teleport`, the loop collapses to edit → run → observe.

## Workflow rules — DO NOT VIOLATE

0. **NEVER hand the operator a CLI command or a "run this in a terminal"
   instruction.** They work GUI-only (see the banner at the top). Every
   action you want them to take is a double-click on a `.sh` launcher or
   a keypress in the app. Need them to update? `Update.sh`. Need them to
   run a new tool? Build a launcher for it. This rule has been broken
   every session — do not be the next.

1. **NEVER `git stash push -u` without confirming what's untracked
   first.** This destroyed the operator's clip library once: the mp4s
   were untracked, `-u` grabbed them, the stash got dropped, library
   gone. `assets/clips/*` and `assets/images/*` are gitignored now, but
   the principle is general: any destructive git op needs `git status`
   + a sanity check first.

2. **NEVER run `git clean`, `git reset --hard`, `rm -rf`, or any
   destructive op on the operator's files** without explicit permission
   AND showing them what will be affected first.

3. **NEVER trust that `git stash` is safe.** Inspect with
   `git stash show stash@{N} --stat` before dropping.

4. **Do web research before guessing about hardware behaviour.** Past
   work wasted days guessing at V3D quirks. Look it up.

5. **Plan before coding for anything bigger than a one-line tweak.**
   Real-hardware deploy loops are expensive. For bigger changes, write
   the plan in chat first and get sign-off.

6. **Don't break what works.** The hybrid is verified and live. Don't
   refactor it "while you're in there"; propose refactors explicitly
   and get a yes.

## Why the architecture is what it is (compressed history)

- **Original pygame/cv2 app:** worked, CPU-bound. This is the base the
  current hybrid is built on.
- **GPU rewrite attempts (moderngl, then single-process GStreamer +
  GTK/VLC):** tried to move the whole pipeline onto the GPU in one
  process. All hit the V3D dual-context state-leak (HUD or output goes
  black the moment a second GL context initialises) or other V3D bugs.
  All reverted. **Don't resurrect the single-process-GL or VLC/GTK
  window path.**
- **The hybrid (current):** keep the working CPU app; reach the GPU
  only through an isolated worker process for generators. Dual-context
  bug can't recur because there's only ever one GL context per process.
  This is the path forward.

## Operator context

- Pi 5 + Pi OS Bookworm + projector + small operator screen.
- ~100+ MP4 loops, mostly 2K H.264 ~5s. **The library was lost once**
  during a git stash mistake. Treat operator data as sacred — losing a
  single file is a serious incident.
- Frustration tolerance is low. Be honest about uncertainty. Own
  mistakes plainly without grovelling. Move forward.

## Not yet built (genuine future work, not a rebuild)

- **Auto/beat mode:** aubio beat detection on a USB mic; scenes swap on
  downbeats, hits on kick onsets, FX intensity tracks RMS.
- **Hailo person matte:** silhouette the performer from a webcam and
  composite over the base.
- **Pre-baked Shadertoy MP4s:** bake favourite shaders offline to H.264
  loops for playback without live GLSL.
